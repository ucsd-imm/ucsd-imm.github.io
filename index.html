	    <p>2016 ISN Forefronts Symposium
	    "The Metabolome and Microbiome in Kidney Disease - New technologies and insights for human diseases"
	    organized by the International Society of Nephrology (ISN), taking place in San Diego (USA) 23-25 September, 2016.

		<h2>Metabolomics for health </h2>
		<p> Our body contains thousands of different metabolites which are involved in various molecular reactions including energy consumption, molecule synthesis and cellular signalling. Our health is maintained by the proper reactions among these metabolites. However, when we have a disease, these reactions may not occur in appropriate ways. Or conversely, if these reactions do not occur in the appropriate ways, we may have symptoms of diseases. These inappropriate reactions may be reflected by the changes in levels of some of these metabolites. We aim to characterize these changes in the patients, investigate the molecular mechanisms behind these changes, predict diseases based on these changes and find molecular drug target which may be effective in treating the diseases.</p>

                <h2>Our methodology</h2>
                <p>
Our team is multidisciplinary - We have physicians, biochemists, molecular biologists, statisticians and computational biologists as the members. We employ various methods to investigate metabolites and their physiological implications. We use GC-MS to measure metabolites, statistical analyses to characterize their profiles, bioinformatics analyses to computationally predict important enzymes and proteins, and validate the prediction using mouse models.</p>

                <h2>Exciting ongoing projects</h2>
<p>
Diabetic kidney disease is the leading cause of ESRD, but few
biomarkers of diabetic kidney disease are available. We used gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry to quantify 94 urine metabolites. We
found that 13 metabolites were significantly reduced in the patients
with diabetic kidney disease. Notably, organic anion transporter-1
(OAT1) knockout mice expressed a similar pattern of reduced levels of
urinary organic acids, and human kidney tissue from patients with
diabetic nephropathy demonstrated lower gene expression of OAT1 and
OAT3. Analysis of bioinformatics data indicated that 12 of the 13
differentially expressed metabolites are linked to mitochondrial
metabolism and suggested global suppression of mitochondrial activity
in diabetic kidney disease. We suggest that urine metabolomics is a
reliable source for biomarkers of diabetic complications, and our data
suggest that renal organic ion transport and mitochondrial function
are dysregulated in diabetic kidney disease.
